**1.Motivation: the problem to be solved**

（1）Online shopping hotter, counterfeiting more serious

The cosmetics industry has always been the hardest hit by false propaganda, especially online. Compared with offline sales, Internet marketing costs are low, but consumers' attention is relatively high, and channels such as live video and micro-business are difficult to supervise. False propaganda and fake sales cases are frequent, which seriously damages consumer rights.

In 2018, the national market supervision departments received a total of 11.2496 million complaints, reports and consultations from consumers, an increase of 20.74% over the same period of last year. Among them, the escalation of consumer complaints soared, and cosmetics consumption complaints ranked first in the year-on-year growth, reaching 246.7%. In 2008 the customs intercepted more than 90,000 large-name cosmetics fakes on the e-commerce platform.

（2）To eliminate fakes, the supply chain needs to be more transparent, and consumers can trace the source of cosmetic goods

In order to put an end to counterfeit goods, it is necessary to control the quality of products from the upstream brands, and at the same time supervise the channels of supply of goods. The transparency of the supply chain helps the final terminal consumption to be protected from counterfeit goods.

（3） The opacity problem of traceability network today

Traditional traceability system is an information island mode by using books centralized or dispersed recorded and preserved. In the centralized book mode, who maintains this book as a center becomes the key to the problems. Whether it is the source company or the channel provider as a stakeholder in the circulation chain, when the book information is not conducive to itself, it is very likely to choose to tamper with the book or falsely book the information for technical reasons.

（4）E-business advantages by using block chain

E-business using block chain technology is really a good solution to the current pain points of fake goods, because the advantages of block chain is a distributed tamper-proof billing systems with its decentralized storage and distribution timestamp. The function is highly consistent with the record requirements of the data in the traceability anti-counterfeiting business. It can be used for the traceability of goods, and solves the problem of counterfeit and shoddy goods in the supply of goods from the root cause to protect consumer rights.

 The two most important features of blockchain technology are the non-tampering of information nodes and the decentralized storage of data. These two basic points ensure the authenticity, stability and reliability of product traceability by using blockchain technology. In this way, we can truly enhance the trust of our products, build a bridge of trust between enterprises and consumers, and at the same time help companies that produce high-quality products to enhance their brand image.

（5）The significance of traceability system for enterprises and consumers

For enterprise: The product quality traceability system is not to supervise the enterprise but to help the company establish a brand image and enhance social and economic benefits. The whole process of tracking management not only strengthens the enterprise quality management, reduces the cost of error correction, but also facilitates the collection of commodity intelligence to understand the consumption trend and improve the rapid response capability.

For consumers: Product traceability allows consumers to fully understand the life cycle information of products, and make consumption more transparent. When quality accidents occur, they can propose appropriate countermeasures to reduce consumers' Loss, so that the interests of consumers can be guaranteed.

Therefore, we are launching **Cosmetic Sourcing Chain(CSC)**– a platform of reliable data, transparent information and interconnected networks.

**2.Solution: how to solve？**

（1）Characteristics of blockchain

The blockchain is a technical system that is jointly maintained by multiple parties, stores data in a blockchain structure, uses cryptography to ensure transmission and access security, and can achieve consistent data storage, cannot be tampered with, and cannot be denied. The birth of blockchain technology marks the beginning of building a truly trustworthy Internet.

First, the blockchain is different from the common centralized information storage mechanism. The decentralized nature determines the openness and equality of the blockchain by many nodes to jointly maintain data.
 Second, the added information added to the blockchain will be stored permanently, and the single node will not be able to modify the data, so the data stability of the blockchain is higher, and it is irreversible and non-repudiation.
 Third, anyone may query data in blockchain, share and exchange data throughout the system, thus maintaining a high degree of block chains open system information and transparency.

（2）CSC Plan

From goods factory retroactively, logistics, sales life cycle, smart contracts based on block chain ensure that the information disclosure, transparency, trusted, and tamper resistance, which will greatly enhance the make-up security capabilities of the product.

Roles：

- Producers: responsible for the production, manufacture, which belong to the upstream. They need to be verified as safe nodes since they are source of information. They can write and read their transaction in CSC and use CSC to facilitate the development of production planning.

- Retailers: responsible for circulation of goods, which belong to the upstream. They can upload information and read transaction related to facilitate distribution planning. For example, cosmetics for dry skin are better sold in the north in the fall and winter seasons, so they can choose distribute more to the north during the seasons.

- Consumers: able to check the source of the cosmetics, the place of production, distributed by whom. They can write and read their transaction in CSC and the entire path from the manufacturer to consumers’ hand is more transparent, and people can use cosmetic more securely.

- Whitelist(God): able to view the whole transaction flow, Suppliers, retailers and consumers can all be chosen to be added into the whitelist.

（3）The contract running process 

The manufacturer first registers the ex-factory goods in the blockchain, and then distributes the merchandise to the next-level dealer. In the next step, each merchandise dealer is registered at receiving the merchandise, and the final merchandise is in retail. The business is purchased by the consumer for final registration and completes the entire factory-multi-level distribution-retail process. Once the goods are registered by the manufacturer, they are registered into the chain.

The current distribution information of the product can be queried, and only the participants in the distribution path are allowed to query. In addition, it is also possible to add a top-level query permission to a specified participant, which can be accomplished by adding to the WhiteList, making it possible to query the distribution information of the item even if it does not participate in the distribution path of a certain item.

For example, a scenario with skin care water in reality with CSC:

Manufacturers will store the digital identity information of skin care water into the blockchain network, and use the QRCode, RFID or NFC tags to achieve one-to-one correspondence. CSC can record data from every step of the factory, circulation, and transaction records.  This will make the data quality endowed with strong trust. Combined with front-end implementation, consumers can get information about the skin care water on production, all sales channels and so on through WeChat, mini-programs, Alipay and other means scanning QRcode.

**3.Rationale: Why such solution but not other alternatives?**

(1) Disadvantages of information system in the original centralized enterprise

The traditional traceability system either uses today's centralized ledger model, or is recorded and preserved by various market participants in a decentralized way which is an information island model. 

For supplier, it is a high cost, and the need for multiple enterprises to get through the data is not good for the privacy data or security of the company. For customer, they are scattered and the base number is large. As results, the cost of access to the centralized system is high and unrealistic.

(2) Advantages of traceability system CSC based on blockchain

- For customer

It can record the process of products from producer to the destination in the block chain. The biggest advantage is that in the end, consumers can access the system, view the distribution information of goods, make the information more transparent, help eliminate mistrust and suspicion, and buy more safely.

- For supplier

At the same time, for producer and retailer, after the product was delivered from the warehouse, it lost control or information previously. However, using this block chain system, they can trace back to the end users, which is helpful for the formulation of production plans and the improvement of sales channels.

- Improvement of efficient

The distribution ledge, plus smart contracts, will eliminate the audit required by internal systems and processes, which is traditionally time-consuming, expensive. This is a huge improvement in the inefficiency of the system.

All in all, the core function of blockchain in the CSC is to realize the transparency and traceability between untrusted partners in the whole production and mobile process. We can build an open, unchangeable global ledger for transactions eventually.

**4.Expected results**

（1）CSC White Paper

（2）Smart Contract demo: The whole process of the product from production to sales, we can see whether the item sold can be tagged in the manufacturer and who is the last distributor.

（3）Functions to be realized: 

- Producers and retailers can check the sales process

- Consumers can check cosmetic information in detail and detect tampering such as main components, the product name, the production date.
