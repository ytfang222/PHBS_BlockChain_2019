The homework implements the ScroogeCoin. ScroogeCoin process transactions and produce the ledger. Scrooge receives a list of transactions, validates the transactions he receives, and publishes a list of validated transactions.

#### TxHandler:

#####1、public TxHandler(UTXOPool utxoPool); 

I make a cope of UTXOPool.

UTXO is unspend transaction output. UTXOPool is the pool of UTXO.

UTXO contains transaction ID txHash, transaction output and index. One UTXO can produce one output.

Once Scrooge has unspent transaction，the output will add into the UTXOpool waiting to deal.



##### 2、public boolean isValidTx(Transaction tx); 

This function has five rules to check the valid of the transaction. Once one transaction pass 5 rules, the function return ture.

Rule 1. Transaction are in the current UTXOpool.

Rule 2. The signature is valid.

Rule 3. One UTXO only claim once.

Rule 4. The output is non-negative.

Rule 5. The output greater than the input.



##### 3、public Transaction[] handleTxs(Transaction[] possibleTxs); 

I am given a set of transaction. First, the function  check each transaction for valid. Second,  it returns a mutually valid array of accepted transactions. Finally, it  updates the current UTXOpool.



#### TxHandlertest:

@before 

In the beginning of the test,  I have 4 people called A、B、C、D who make transaction. I use KeyPairGenerator kpg = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance("RSA") to generate 4 public key for each person.

I use the UTXOPool generating the transaction ledge and I give A 100 as initial property. I think @before is really a good button because it runs each time before @test which is understandable and consice. 



@test

I make 5 test functions which contain valid test,  non-negative transaction, single in and single out, single in multiple out, multiple in single out,  double spending, output valid.

###### Test1:Valid transaction

I make three different transaction. 

| Transaction        | T or F | Describe                               |
| ------------------ | ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| B to B 100         | F      | B does not have initial property.      |
| A to B 100         | T      | This tests single in and single out.   |
| A to B 40, to C 60 | T      | This tests single in and multiple out. |



###### Test2: input>output and output is non-negative

| Transaction         | T or F | Describe                                    |
| ------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| A to B 40, to C 70  | F      | this is output over input which is invalid. |
| A to B 40, to C -70 | F      | this is negative output which is invalid.   |



###### Test3:single in and multiple out

| Transaction       | T or F | Describe                                         |
| ----------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| A to B 100        | T      | Single in and multiple out is valid transaction. |
| B to C 50,to D 50 | T      |                                                  |



###### Test4:multiple in and single out

| Transaction    | T or F | Describe                                               |
| -------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| A to B 100     | T      | B to D 50 and C to D 40 is multiple in and single out. |
| B to C 50,to D | T      |                                                        |
| C to D 40      | T      |                                                        |



Test5:double spending

| Transaction | T or F | Describe                                                     |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| A to B 100  | T      | single in and single out.                                    |
| B to C 100  | T      | The transaction B to C happened so later B to D is invalid because this transaction is recorded in the ledger. |
| B to D 100  | F      |                                                              |
